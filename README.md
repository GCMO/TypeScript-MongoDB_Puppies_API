# TypeScript-MongoDB_Puppies_API

STACK:

TypeScript, Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

OBJECTIVE:

This simple project was an attempt at creating a simple API for puppies (yes the cute lil dogs) based on TypeScript. Each `puppy` has
the following attributes: 
    - id
    - breed
    - name
    - birth date

PURPOSE:

To familiarize myself with establishing the environment, installing dependencies and working with how Node.JS & Express adapt to TypeScript.

LEARNING CURVE: 

Even though the initial setup was cumbersom and a bit tentative. It was excellent to see TypeScript in action: it's great to be
able to set Types and also see how TS actually infuses the type to the varible based on the value assigned. It was also very import to note
how TS is compiled and how it is then turned back in to JS: see DIST folder

FILES:
Server.ts - initializes the server
Routes.ts - all client/server routes are here
Model.ts  - establishes the schema of the DB
